# Pane Release Instructions

Pane releases are cut from a clean `main` checkout with `scripts/release.js`.
The script updates `package.json`, commits `release: vX.Y.Z`, tags the same
commit, pushes `HEAD:main`, and pushes the tag.

The same release commit also keeps the npm and PyPI wrapper package versions in
sync through `scripts/sync-runpane-package-versions.js`.

## Mechanical Invariants

Before a release, these facts must be true:

- The worktree is clean.
- `HEAD` matches `origin/main`.
- For inferred bumps (`patch`, `minor`, `major`), `package.json` version matches
  the latest `v*` semver tag.
- `packages/runpane/package.json`, `packages/runpane-py/pyproject.toml`, and
  `packages/runpane-py/src/runpane/__init__.py` match the root release version.
- The release tag does not already exist locally or on `origin`.
- Dependencies are installed before running the release script so commit hooks can
  run successfully.

If `package.json` and the latest release tag disagree, do not run an inferred
patch. Decide the intended next version and run an explicit release instead:

```bash
pnpm run release 2.2.1
```

## Happy Path

```bash
git switch main
git pull --ff-only origin main
git status --porcelain
git tag --list 'v*' --sort=-v:refname | head -5
node -p "require('./package.json').version"

pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
pnpm run check:runpane-package-versions
pnpm run test:runpane-contract
pnpm run test:runpane-package-smoke
pnpm test:ci:minimal

pnpm run release patch
```

If the release commit fails, the script aborts before creating or pushing a tag
as long as any changes remain in the worktree. Fix the hook, dependency, or
typecheck failure, restore the worktree, and rerun the release.

Use `minor`, `major`, or an explicit version when that is the intended release:

```bash
pnpm run release minor
pnpm run release major
pnpm run release 2.3.0
```

## GitHub Workflows

Pull requests to `main` run:

- `Code Quality`
  - typecheck
  - lint
  - runpane wrapper compatibility tests across Node, Python, Linux, macOS, and Windows
  - main process tests on Linux, macOS, and Windows
  - frontend unit tests
  - maintained Playwright smoke tests
  - `CI result`, the one check branch protection requires; it fails when any
    other `Code Quality` job fails or is cancelled

Pushes to `main` run:

- `Code Quality`
- `Deploy Remote PWA Preview`

`v*` tag pushes run:

- `Build & Release`
  - macOS Apple Silicon and Intel installers
  - Linux installer artifacts
  - Windows x64 installer
  - Windows arm64 installer
  - GitHub release publishing
  - `SHA256SUMS.txt`
  - npm `runpane` publish
  - PyPI `runpane` publish
  - Homebrew cask `pane` pushed to `greenfield-inc/homebrew-tap`
  - winget manifests for `Dcouple.Pane` in the `packaging-vX.Y.Z` artifact
- `Notify website on release`

`scripts/render-packaging.sh` fills the templates in `packaging/` with the
version and the checksums of the macOS `.dmg` and Windows `.exe` files. A manual
`Build & Release` run with **publish** unchecked is a dry run: it builds,
renders and audits the cask, uploads the `packaging-<release_tag>` artifact,
and publishes nothing.

The release is not considered complete until the tag-triggered `Build & Release`
run succeeds and the GitHub release is published.

## Verification

After `pnpm run release ...` finishes:

```bash
git fetch origin main --tags
git rev-parse HEAD
git rev-parse origin/main
git tag --points-at HEAD
gh run list --limit 10
gh release view vX.Y.Z
```

Confirm:

- `HEAD` and `origin/main` point at the release commit.
- The release commit has the expected `vX.Y.Z` tag.
- `Build & Release` succeeded for the tag.
- `npm view runpane version` reports `X.Y.Z`.
- `python3 -m pip index versions runpane` includes `X.Y.Z`.
- `brew info --cask greenfield-inc/tap/pane` reports `X.Y.Z`.
- `Notify website on release` succeeded for the tag.
- `Code Quality` succeeded for the release commit on `main`.
- `Deploy Remote PWA Preview` succeeded for the release commit on `main`.

## winget

Submit the manifests in the tag run's `packaging-vX.Y.Z` artifact (the
`winget/` folder) to [microsoft/winget-pkgs](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs),
for example with `wingetcreate submit <folder>`. Submissions are manual.

## Required Secrets

GitHub Actions provides `GITHUB_TOKEN` automatically.

The npm and PyPI packages should publish through trusted publishing:

- npm: configure a trusted publisher for package `runpane` on npmjs.com with
  repository `greenfield-inc/Pane`, workflow filename `build.yml`, and `npm publish`
  permission. The workflow installs npm `11.5.1` or newer for OIDC support.
- PyPI: configure a trusted publisher for project `runpane` with repository
  `greenfield-inc/Pane`, workflow filename `build.yml`, and GitHub environment `pypi`.

Fallback token publishing is allowed only for first package reservation or
manual recovery. Use `NPM_TOKEN` or `PYPI_API_TOKEN` as local environment
variables or GitHub Actions secrets, do not commit token files such as `.npmrc`
or `.pypirc`, and revoke or rotate the tokens after use.

The npm publish passes `--provenance`, so each version carries a provenance
attestation linking it to this workflow run.

The release and preview workflows also depend on repository secrets and
variables configured in GitHub Actions. Relevant examples include:

- `SITE_REPO_DISPATCH_TOKEN` for website release notification.
- `HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN` to push the cask to `greenfield-inc/homebrew-tap`. Without
  it the `homebrew` job logs a notice and skips.
- Google Cloud workload identity, service account, project, and region values
  for the remote PWA preview deploy.
- Platform signing or publishing credentials if signing is re-enabled.

## Auto-Update Files

The build process generates update metadata and installers under
`dist-electron/` in the release workflow:

- `latest-mac.yml`
- `latest-linux.yml`
- `latest-linux-arm64.yml`
- `latest.yml`
- macOS `.dmg` and `.zip`
- Linux `.deb` and `.AppImage`
- Windows `.exe`
- npm package `runpane`
- PyPI package `runpane`

## Rollback

Do not retag an existing version. If a release has a critical issue:

1. Fix the issue on `main`.
2. Cut a new patch version.
3. Leave the broken tag/release history intact unless maintainers explicitly
   decide to remove it.

Users can always manually download the latest good release from GitHub Releases.
